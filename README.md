# MatchIt 
A samegame Implemented by Agouazi Lynda & Nour CHAMI & Sahnoune Thilleli.


SameGame is a puzzle game centered around matching tiles. The game board is comprised of a grid featuring colored tiles. 
The objective is to eliminate as many tiles as feasible by choosing groups of neighboring tiles that share the same color.

# Code description
